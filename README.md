# Rehydrate

This React web app consumes an associated API that contains quiz questions.  Rehydrate aims to educate all populations about corporate water consumption, the current water crisis, and other climate/social impacts.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to update a former hackathon project (https://devpost.com/software/rehydrate) from June 2021, which was created using one of the hackathon sponsor's browser-based IDE.  I wanted to add the Quiz feature that my teammates and I weren't able to add, as well as gain practice using SCSS and React Testing Library.

## Future Updates
* Add feature that allows a user to access and download infographics
* Add feature that allows a user to share infographics and quiz score to social media
